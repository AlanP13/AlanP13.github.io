  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>
    I’m an <strong>Enterprise Data Engineer</strong> working at the intersection of <strong>financial systems</strong>,
    <strong> cloud platforms</strong>, and <strong>data reliability</strong>. My work focuses on modernizing investment
    accounting workflows by building scalable, production-grade pipelines that prioritize accuracy, auditability, and long-term maintainability.
  </p>

  <p>
    At Genworth Financial, I own and support critical accounting platforms across fixed income, derivatives, and commercial mortgage loans,
    collaborating closely with Accounting, Operations, and Infrastructure teams.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alongside my professional work, I’m pursuing a <strong>PhD in Information Technology</strong> with a focus on <strong>AI and Data Science</strong>,
    centered on applying intelligent, data-driven techniques to enterprise systems and automation.
