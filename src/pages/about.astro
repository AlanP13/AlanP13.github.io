  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>
    Hey! I’m <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alan.palayil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="dotted-link">Alan Palayil</a>, an 
    <strong>Enterprise Data Engineer</strong> working at the intersection of <strong>Financial Systems</strong>,
    <strong> Cloud Platforms</strong>, and <strong>Data Reliability</strong>. My work focuses on modernizing investment
    accounting workflows by building scalable, production-grade pipelines that prioritize <strong>accuracy</strong>,<strong> auditability</strong>, and <strong>long-term maintainability</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I currently work at <a href="https://www.genworth.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="dotted-link">Genworth Financial</a>, 
    where I own and support critical accounting platforms across <strong>Fixed Income</strong>, <strong>Derivatives</strong>, and <strong>Commercial Mortgage Loans</strong>, 
    collaborating closely with Accounting, Operations, and Infrastructure teams 
    to deliver systems that are both technically robust and business-critical.
  </p>
  <p>
    Alongside my professional work, I’m pursuing a <a href="https://www.ucumberlands.edu/academics/graduate/phd-information-technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="dotted-link">PhD in Information Technology</a>
    with a focus on <strong>AI</strong> and <strong>Data Science</strong>, centered on applying intelligent, data-driven techniques to enterprise systems and automation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of work, I enjoy <strong>painting</strong>, <strong>digital art</strong>, <strong>3D printing</strong>, <strong>gaming</strong>, and building creative projects</strong> 
    that blend engineering with design. 
    I’m always exploring new ideas—whether that’s improving data systems or creating something tangible in the real world.
