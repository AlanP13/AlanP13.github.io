summary: "A hands-on exploration of operating systems and systems engineering concepts applied to real-world infrastructure, data platforms, and performance-critical systems."
highlights:
  - "Reframed OS concepts as practical engineering tools for data platforms and distributed systems"
  - "Explored scheduling, memory, I/O, and concurrency through experiments and failure analysis"
  - "Mapped low-level systems concepts to real production architectures (Spark, pipelines, financial systems)"
impact:
  - "Strengthened systems-level reasoning for performance, reliability, and debugging"
  - "Built a mental model for diagnosing complex production failures and bottlenecks"
  - "Bridged low-level OS theory with real-world platform engineering"

## Context

Modern data platforms and distributed systems are **operating systems in disguise**. This project treats OS concepts not as academic topics, but as **practical tools** for building and debugging real infrastructure.

---

## What This Is

A modular, applied systems engineering repository where each topic focuses on:

- A core systems concept (scheduling, memory, I/O, concurrency, failure modes)
- Experiments or simulations
- Performance and failure analysis
- Mapping to real systems (Spark, data pipelines, financial platforms)

---

## Outcomes

- Stronger intuition for performance bottlenecks and failure modes  
- Practical understanding of how OS-level behavior shapes production systems  
- A reusable mental framework for debugging complex infrastructure  

---

## Why This Matters

This work directly supports how I approach **platform engineering, data pipelines, and reliability work today**: reason from first principles, observe system behavior, and fix the real bottleneck.
