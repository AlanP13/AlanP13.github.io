title: "Convo Care — Privacy-First AI Risk Triage Platform"
featured: false
summary: "Designed and built a privacy-first AI system that analyzes text and voice conversations to produce sentiment and mental-health risk scores without storing transcripts or raw audio."
highlights:
  - "Built a full-stack platform (FastAPI + React) for text and voice-based risk scoring"
  - "Implemented in-memory speech-to-text and NLP scoring with zero transcript persistence"
  - "Designed a scores-only data model for privacy-preserving analytics and trend tracking"
  - "Delivered per-student risk trends, history, and high-risk flagging"
impact:
  - "Demonstrated how AI systems can be designed with privacy as a first-class constraint"
  - "Produced a reusable pattern for compliant AI decision-support pipelines"
  - "Showcased end-to-end system design: ingestion, scoring, storage, and visualization"

## Context

In sensitive domains like mental health, **data privacy is a core system constraint**. Storing transcripts or audio creates unnecessary risk, even when the goal is only trend analysis and triage.

This project explores a **scores-only AI pipeline**:

> Analyze → score → discard raw data → retain only safe metrics.

---

## What This Is

A **web-based AI decision-support platform** that:

- Accepts text or voice input
- Transcribes audio **in memory**
- Runs sentiment and risk scoring models
- Stores **only numerical scores and safe metadata**
- Presents trends, history, and high-risk flags in a React dashboard

The backend is built with FastAPI and MySQL, and the frontend uses React with WebRTC for voice capture.

## Outcomes

- A working demonstration of privacy-first AI system design  
- A full-stack, containerized platform with real-time scoring flows  
- A reusable architectural pattern for compliant AI analytics systems

## Why This Matters

This project reflects how I design AI in production environments:

> Treat data handling, privacy, and compliance as **system-level architecture decisions**, not afterthoughts.
