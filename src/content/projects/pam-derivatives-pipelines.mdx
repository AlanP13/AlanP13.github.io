## Context & Problem

We transitioned derivatives processing from a third-party vendor platform into PAM to reduce costs and consolidate enterprise accounting workflows, while also beginning cloud migration efforts.

## What I Built

- Azure Synapse pipelines for data transformation and validation  
- Message generation and journal creation workflows aligned to PAM requirements  
- Reconciliation checks to detect data issues early  
- Monitoring patterns and operational runbooks to support daily reliability

## Outcomes

- Enabled major platform consolidation while moving workloads toward Azure  
- Established standardized patterns for future pipelines and migrations  
- Improved auditability and operational efficiency for recurring workflows

## What I’d Improve Next

- Increase reuse via template-driven generation patterns to reduce repeated code  
- Expand automated anomaly detection for quicker triage
