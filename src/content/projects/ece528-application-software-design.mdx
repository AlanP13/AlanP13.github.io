## Context & Problem

ECE528 emphasizes building software that is not only functional, but also maintainable and well-structured.

This repository captures my homework submissions and a course project, organized in a way that reflects professional engineering habits: clean structure, version control, and documented deliverables. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## What’s Included

- A `Homework/` directory containing assignment work :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- A `Project/` directory containing the larger course project deliverable :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- A course syllabus PDF stored in the repository :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

## Why This Matters

This repo demonstrates my ability to:

- Organize and ship work as incremental deliverables  
- Keep coursework and project development cleanly structured  
- Use version control as a default workflow for building software
