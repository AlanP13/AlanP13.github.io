title: "PAM CML Migration & JSON Message Generation Platform"
featured: true
summary: "Led the migration of CML accounting into Genworth’s PAM platform by building a production-grade, template-driven JSON message generation and ingestion pipeline used daily in production."
highlights:
  - "Designed and built a rules-driven JSON message generation engine supporting multiple transaction types"
  - "Implemented DEV / UAT / PROD environment separation with versioned production releases (V1–V7)"
  - "Replaced vendor-managed processing with an internally owned, automated accounting pipeline"
  - "Built reconciliation and validation to ensure auditability and data correctness"
impact:
  - "Eliminated external vendor dependency for CML accounting workflows"
  - "Established a stable, production-critical pipeline processing financial transactions daily"
  - "Improved visibility, control, and auditability of accounting data flows"

## Context

CML accounting was previously handled by an external vendor, creating cost, operational risk, and limited system visibility. Genworth’s internal PAM platform could support CML—but required a **reliable, production-grade ingestion and message translation layer**.

---

## What I Built

A **production JSON message generation and ingestion platform** that:

- Extracts transaction data from enterprise data sources  
- Applies business rules and special-case logic  
- Generates PAM-compatible JSON messages across many transaction types  
- Supports time-based and batch-based production runs  
- Operates across DEV / UAT / PROD with strict versioning (V1–V7)  

This system now runs **daily in production** and is business-critical.

## Reliability & Operations

Because this is financial data:

- Validation and reconciliation are built into the pipeline  
- Failures surface early and are operationally visible  
- Release versions are controlled and auditable  
- The system is actively supported in production by me  

---

## Outcomes

- Successfully migrated CML accounting off a third-party vendor  
- Reduced long-term costs and operational risk  
- Established a stable, internally owned accounting pipeline  
- Improved auditability and system transparency

## Why This Matters

This project demonstrates my ability to **design, ship, and own production-critical financial infrastructure**—not just prototypes or one-off scripts.
