## Context & Problem

I wanted to explore a practical, affordable approach to home automation—combining Arduino-based control with networking and IoT ideas so the system could be monitored and managed remotely.

---

## What I Built

This repository includes the building blocks of a smart home prototype:

- An Arduino sketch (`ultimate_home_automation.ino`) as the system controller  
- MQTT and sensor library dependencies included alongside the project  
- Hardware documentation artifacts: component images, wiring references, and report materials  
- Cost planning spreadsheets and comparison files for budget-driven decisions  

---

## Outcomes

- A working prototype path for Arduino-based automation using IoT concepts  
- A documented engineering process that balances feasibility, cost, and scalability  

---

## Why This Matters

This project demonstrates my ability to:

- Build end-to-end prototypes across hardware + software  
- Integrate sensors and connectivity into a cohesive system  
- Document designs clearly (cost, wiring, and implementation)
