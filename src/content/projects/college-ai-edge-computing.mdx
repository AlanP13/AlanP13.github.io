title: "AgriEdge AI — Edge-Deployed Visual Risk Classification Platform"
featured: false
summary: "Designed a production-style edge AI inference system that performs low-latency visual risk classification at the edge and routes high-value cases into centralized data pipelines."
highlights:
  - "Built a clear separation between training, inference, and orchestration layers"
  - "Implemented edge-optimized real-time and batch inference pipelines"
  - "Designed a system that filters and routes data to reduce bandwidth and central compute cost"
  - "Documented full system architecture, tradeoffs, and deployment model"
impact:
  - "Demonstrated a reusable edge-AI pattern applicable to insurance, manufacturing, and inspection systems"
  - "Showed how tiered processing can improve latency, cost, and scalability"
  - "Proved ability to design AI systems, not just train models"

## Context

In many real systems, **sending all data to the cloud is expensive and slow**. Most data is low-value; only a small fraction requires deeper processing.

This project demonstrates a **tiered decision pipeline**:

> Classify at the edge → forward only high-risk or high-value cases → process centrally.

## What I Built

A **production-style edge AI system** with:

- Separate layers for:
  - Model training
  - Edge inference
  - Batch inference
  - Orchestration and routing
- Real-time and batch image classification flows
- A pluggable decision-routing layer
- A full ingestion and preprocessing pipeline

The demo domain uses plant disease imagery, but the **architecture is domain-agnostic** and mirrors patterns used in insurance, manufacturing, and document processing systems.

## Outcomes

- A reusable reference architecture for edge AI + data pipelines  
- A working demonstration of low-latency, cost-aware compute routing  
- A concrete example of AI system design beyond notebooks

## Why This Matters

This project shows how I approach AI as **infrastructure and systems engineering**, not just model training:

> Build decision pipelines, control cost and latency, and design for deployment from day one.
