title: "Enterprise Event Simulation Platform"
featured: false
summary: "A configuration-driven simulation platform for testing distributed systems under realistic conditions such as burst traffic, out-of-order delivery, retries, and partial failures."
highlights:
  - "Built a scenario-driven simulator to exercise distributed systems before production releases"
  - "Supports burst and steady event generation, routing, transformation, and sinks"
  - "Implements deterministic replay for debugging and regression validation"
  - "Models real failure modes: timeouts, retries, backpressure, drop rates, and partial outages"
impact:
  - "Provides a repeatable testbed for validating system behavior and data correctness"
  - "Enables reproduction of hard-to-debug production failure scenarios using configuration"
  - "Demonstrates strong reliability, testing, and systems-engineering mindset"

## Context

Distributed systems fail in **predictable but hard-to-reproduce ways**: out-of-order events, retries, backpressure, partial outages, and timing issues.

This project exists to make those failures **deterministic, repeatable, and testable before production**.

---

## What This Is

A **configuration-driven event simulation platform** consisting of:

- A Java-based simulator runtime
- A scenario library for realistic workloads (financial-style events, device fleets, failure tests)
- Environment and behavior configuration profiles
- Deterministic replay for debugging and regression testing

Most scenarios can be created **without code changes**—only configuration.

---

## Outcomes

- A reusable platform for testing system behavior under stress and failure  
- A controlled way to validate data correctness and system resilience  
- A practical demonstration of reliability engineering and test infrastructure design

## Why This Matters

This is the same philosophy used in mature data platforms and distributed systems:

> Don’t wait for production to discover failure modes. Simulate them, reproduce them, and fix them early.
