## Context & Problem

The Commercial Mortgage Loan (CML) accounting workflow was previously handled by an external vendor, which introduced ongoing costs, limited flexibility, and reduced visibility into data processing and reconciliation.

Genworth’s internal PAM accounting platform already had the functional capability to support CML transactions, but required a reliable ingestion and processing layer to replace the vendor solution without disrupting daily accounting operations. The migration needed to meet strict requirements around data accuracy, auditability, and operational stability.

This project focused on transitioning CML accounting into PAM while ensuring the resulting system could operate reliably under daily production workloads.

## My Role

I served as the **lead engineer and IT owner** for the CML migration, with end-to-end responsibility for design, implementation, and production support.

My responsibilities included:
- Designing the new data ingestion and processing workflows  
- Building and maintaining the transformation and message generation logic  
- Coordinating with Accounting, Operations, and Infrastructure teams  
- Supporting the system post-migration as the primary escalation point

## What I Built

The migration replaced vendor-managed processing with an internally owned, automated pipeline.

Key components included:
- **Data ingestion and transformation** using Markit EDM as the enterprise data source  
- **Python-based message generation** to convert warehouse data into PAM-ready accounting messages  
- **Job orchestration** using AppWorx to manage daily execution and dependencies  
- **Reconciliation and validation checks** to identify data issues early and improve confidence in downstream processing  

The solution was designed to operate on a **daily cadence** with minimal manual intervention, while still allowing clear visibility into failures when issues occurred.

## Reliability & Operations

Given the financial and regulatory sensitivity of accounting data, reliability was a core design goal.

To support stable operations:
- Validation and reconciliation logic was built directly into the pipeline  
- Failures were surfaced early and investigated by IT before escalation to business teams  
- Processing patterns were standardized to reduce operational ambiguity  
- The system was actively supported in production after go-live  

This approach improved both day-to-day reliability and confidence during audit-sensitive periods.

## Outcomes

- Successfully migrated CML accounting from an external vendor into PAM  
- Reduced long-term vendor costs by leveraging in-house platform capabilities  
- Improved visibility, control, and auditability of accounting data flows  
- Established a stable, production-supported CML accounting pipeline

## Design Philosophy & Lessons Learned

A key design objective was **future compatibility** — moving toward systems that require fewer operational touch points over time.

If revisiting the project today, I would:
- Refactor transformation logic into **template-driven message generation** to reduce repetition  
- Further decouple business rules from formatting logic to improve maintainability  
- Expand automated checks to catch edge cases even earlier in the workflow

## Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Own critical financial systems end-to-end  
- Design data pipelines that balance correctness, reliability, and operational clarity  
- Lead enterprise migrations without disrupting daily business processes  
- Support systems in production, not just deliver initial implementations
