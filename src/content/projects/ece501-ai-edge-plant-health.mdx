## Context & Problem

Plant diseases are a major threat to food security, and timely detection is critical for intervention. Manual inspection is time-consuming and difficult to scale across farms, nurseries, and greenhouse environments.

This project explored a practical edge-AI approach: combine vision-based disease classification with environmental signals to deliver more reliable assessment and risk insights.

## My Role

I contributed to the system end-to-end, including:

- Designing the overall architecture (vision + sensors + inference workflow)  
- Developing and testing a CNN-based classification pipeline  
- Integrating sensor signals (humidity + thermal-derived VPD) into the evaluation flow  
- Packaging final documentation and presentations for delivery

## What I Built

### AI + Vision Pipeline
- A CNN-based model for plant disease classification  
- Frame extraction from a USB camera feed for real-time testing and evaluation  

### Sensor-Enhanced Risk Signals
- Thermal imaging support to estimate leaf temperature and compute VPD (Vapor Pressure Deficit)  
- DHT10 humidity sensing to provide environmental context for disease-risk evaluation  

### Documentation & Deliverables
- Project report and presentation materials covering objectives, approach, experiments, and results

## Outcomes

- Demonstrated an integrated system combining deep learning with environmental sensing  
- Showed how thermal + humidity signals can strengthen risk context beyond images alone  
- Validated a practical path toward edge-deployable plant monitoring workflows
