title: "MQTT Smart Home Controller (Arduino + IoT)"
featured: false
summary: "Designed and built a modular Arduino-based home automation controller using MQTT for telemetry and control, exploring event-driven device architecture, embedded systems, and IoT system design."
highlights:
  - "Built a bidirectional MQTT-based control plane for sensors and actuators (publish telemetry, subscribe to commands)"
  - "Designed a modular firmware structure to support multiple sensors, rooms, and devices"
  - "Integrated real hardware: DHT sensors, relay modules, and embedded I/O control"
  - "Documented full system including wiring, hardware artifacts, and build process"
impact:
  - "Demonstrated early system-architecture thinking: message-based control, device decoupling, and extensibility"
  - "Built foundational experience with event-driven systems that parallels modern data pipelines and distributed systems"
  - "Proved ability to ship end-to-end systems spanning hardware, firmware, and software integration"

## Context

I wanted to explore how **event-driven, message-based architectures** (common in modern data systems) can be applied to physical devices using low-cost hardware.

---

## What I Built

A small but complete **MQTT-driven smart home controller**:

- Arduino firmware that publishes sensor data and subscribes to control commands  
- Decoupled, message-based control via an MQTT broker  
- Hardware integration with DHT sensors and relay modules  
- Full project artifacts: wiring diagrams, BOM, and setup docs  

---

## Architecture
```
Sensors → Arduino Firmware → MQTT Broker → Dashboard / Automation
← Commands / Control Topics
```

---

## Outcomes

- A working, extensible message-driven control system  
- A reusable pattern for adding more devices and sensors  
- A concrete demonstration of event-driven and decoupled system design

## Why This Matters

Although this is a hardware project, it demonstrates the same principles I use in large systems today: **message-based pipelines, decoupling, and control-vs-data plane separation**.
