title: "Operational Automation & Reliability Hardening"
featured: true
summary: "Built automation and scheduling guardrails to eliminate manual operational workflows and improve reliability of daily production processes."
highlights:
  - "Automated cross-server file movement and job execution using Python and AppWorx"
  - "Introduced dependency-aware scheduling and file-availability gates to prevent premature processing"
  - "Implemented automated failure detection and notification to shorten incident response time"
  - "Replaced manual, error-prone procedures with repeatable, code-driven workflows"
impact:
  - "Eliminated most daily manual intervention from critical operational workflows"
  - "Improved reliability, predictability, and operational confidence in recurring jobs"

## Context

Daily production workflows depended on **manual file movement and human coordination**, creating avoidable risk, delays, and operational friction.

---

## What I Built

- Automated, reliable file transfers between systems  
- Dependency-aware scheduling with wait conditions and gating  
- Clear, automated failure signaling to speed up triage and recovery  

---

## Outcomes

- Removed most manual touch points from daily operations  
- Improved stability and predictability of downstream processing  
- Established an automation-first operational baseline  

---

## Why This Matters

This work demonstrates **production ownership and reliability thinking**: eliminate human-in-the-loop steps, add guardrails, and make routine operations boring and predictable.
