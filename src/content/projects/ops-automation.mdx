featured: true
summary: "Automated recurring operational workflows to reduce manual intervention and improve daily system reliability."
highlights:
  - "Automated daily file transfers between servers to reduce manual handling"
  - "Implemented scheduler dependencies (file waiting) to prevent premature processing"
  - "Added automated error detection and notification to shorten investigation time"
  - "Replaced legacy manual workflows with repeatable, code-driven automation"
impact:
  - "Significantly reduced daily manual effort and operational friction"

## Context & Problem

Recurring tasks depended on manual file drops and intervention, creating operational risk and wasting time during daily runs.

## What I Built

- Scripted transfers to move files reliably between servers  
- AppWorx scheduling with dependency awareness and wait conditions  
- Automated error emails and clear failure visibility for faster response

## Outcomes

- Reduced touch points in daily operations  
- Improved predictability for downstream processing  
- Established an automation-first baseline for future workflows

## What I’d Improve Next

- Centralize configuration and logging for easier auditing and scaling
