## Thesis

Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) creates value when treated as an **integrated management discipline**—not a compliance checklist—by tying risk decisions to **strategy-setting and performance**.

## What I Covered

- What ERM is and how it differs from siloed “traditional risk management”
- Why organizations adopt ERM and the value it unlocks (resilience, capital allocation, decision quality)
- Practical implementation challenges (culture, fragmented data, weak governance)
- How ERM connects to IT and cybersecurity governance using established frameworks

## Frameworks & Concepts

- COSO ERM (2017): integrating risk with strategy and performance
- NIST-aligned risk management thinking (enterprise + IT/cyber alignment)
- Risk appetite translated into measurable thresholds, escalation triggers, and KRIs

## Case Study: Eli Lilly

Highlights how ERM becomes actionable when embedded in:
- planning and budgeting cycles
- cross-functional governance structures
- portfolio-level risk views (not isolated risk registers)

## Why It Matters (Portfolio Angle)

This work reflects how I approach enterprise platforms:
- build **low-touch operations** through proactive controls
- use risk signals and governance structures to reduce operational ambiguity
- treat reliability as a strategic outcome, not just an IT metric
