status: published
area: ["Cloud & Infrastructure", "Security", "Resilience Engineering"]
summary: "Designed a structured disaster recovery plan for a hybrid environment with clear RTO/RPO targets, operational roles, and test cadence."
relevance: "Maps directly to my enterprise pipeline work: recovery design, operational runbooks, validation, and reducing time-to-restore for critical workflows."

## Context

In financial IT environments, outages impact:
- transaction processing
- accounting close
- regulatory reporting
- daily ETL + automation chains

This plan defines how to recover a **hybrid architecture** (cloud + on-prem) safely and predictably.

## What the Plan Includes

### Critical Components & Targets
Defined RTO/RPO expectations for key systems, including databases, ETL, accounting applications, schedulers, and file automation services.

### Roles & Responsibilities
Clear ownership across incident command, DR lead, DBA, cloud ops, scheduler owner, and security.

### Activation Criteria
Triggers include ransomware/database corruption, cloud region outage, scheduler failure blocking EOD, and data integrity compromise.

## Recovery Procedures (Runbook Style)

- database restore + log replay to meet tight RPO targets
- ETL failover using infrastructure-as-code patterns
- application rebuild + connection repointing to DR database aliases
- scheduler promotion + priority chain resumption
- file restore with malware scanning + checksum validation

## Testing Cadence

Includes quarterly/semiannual/annual drills (DB failover, ETL failover, scheduler simulation, full end-to-end DR exercise), plus backup integrity checks.

## Why It Matters (Portfolio Angle)

This work shows how I think about reliability:
- define targets (RTO/RPO) early
- make recovery steps executable and owned
- test regularly to avoid “paper DR”
- design for auditability and operational clarity
