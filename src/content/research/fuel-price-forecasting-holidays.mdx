## Problem

Retail fuel pricing is influenced by:
- short-term inertia (recent price history)
- macro indicators (CPI, unemployment)
- seasonality and holiday demand shifts

This project forecasts **weekly Fuel_Price** for a store over time and evaluates whether holidays show measurable pricing differences.

## Approach

### Baseline
A simple lag baseline: “last week’s price ≈ this week’s price”

### Model
A **Random Forest Regressor** using engineered features such as:
- lagged Fuel_Price
- calendar fields (month/week effects)
- holiday flag (`IsHoliday`)
- macroeconomic indicators (CPI, unemployment)

## Results & Insights

- Random Forest outperformed the naive lag baseline by capturing non-linear structure.
- Holiday vs non-holiday weeks showed **modest but systematic differences**.
- Feature importance emphasized:
  - lagged price history as the strongest driver
  - macro + seasonal signals as meaningful secondary contributors

## Why It Matters (Portfolio Angle)

This is a clean example of “real-world ML”:
- start with a strong baseline
- build interpretable improvements
- quantify holiday effects instead of assuming them
- communicate outcomes in a business-usable way
